      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 2010, Fictional Co. began as a small startup with a big dream: 
        to simplify everyday life with smart, creative technology. Over the years, 
        we’ve grown into a global team of innovators and thinkers.
      </p>
      <p>
        From our first app launch to expanding across continents, our journey has 
        been about resilience, bold ideas, and building long-lasting relationships 
        with our customers.
        A fictional company is a business entity that exists only in the realm of 
        fiction, often appearing in books, movies, television shows, video games, 
        or other creative works. These companies can be original creations or parodies 
        of real-world businesses, and they can serve various purposes within their 
        fictional universes, from plot devices to satirical commentary.
